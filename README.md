# BrainConn
## Introduction
This work is a code repository for the course NBE-E4530 (Human Brain Connectivity) at Aalto University in the NBE group during my doctoral study.

## Expected learnings
1. Application of Graph theory
- To be clear about nodes, edges in human brain.
- What to consider in which case

2. Difference in data handeling in case of different modalities
- Differeces to consider in difference data
- Useful measurements to consider
- Task related vs resting state
3. Considerable parameters and methods
- Improtance of preprocessing in connectivity analysis
- Methods for analysis
- Sensor level vs source level?
- Individial level vs Group level
4. Visualization
- Efficient visualization of underneath network
- What to show what and what not?
5. Result interpretation
- What to conclude from the result graphs
- How to correlate the findings with brain functions
6. Other pros and cons
- Applications and Limitations
- Further possibile developments
- Clinical applicability and reliability

## Expected hands-on and practice
1. Hands on exercise 
2. Work on real data (MEG data)
3. Write own codes for analysis (in Matlab)

## Course Credit
- I need credit for my Doctoral course work.
